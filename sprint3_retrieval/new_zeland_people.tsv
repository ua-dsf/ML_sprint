Frustrated by the limitations of the medium, Ellison abandoned political cartooning and began a bizarre weekly cartoon 'Meantime' for the New Zealand Listener.' Meantime' survived two changes of editor before being dropped by the current editor who favoured a more conservative approach to the magazine. More recently he is the creator of the controversial animated character 'Media Dog' for the media satire show Eating Media Lunch and also created the 1920s pastiche Happy Hori for the comedy show The Unauthorised History of New Zealand. According to an interview with Chris Slane, Ellison doesnÕt use story boards for his animations, ""just writes a script, takes it into the recording studio and sees what happens"". In 2005, Ellison made his first foray into live action comedy with the one-off television pilot 'Barry'. New Zealand Listener TV critic Diana Witchel describes Ellison's television work as representing ""some of the most disturbing material on television this side of Destiny TV"" and goes on to say that 'Barry' ""as comment on the pretensions of the intelligentsia, the gullibility of the media and the stunning incomprehensibility of late-night innovative comedy, itÕs a triumph.""In addition to editorial cartoons he has also published adult minicomics, including 'Popeye has a Fuck' (1977),'Tard' (1998), and 'Ray Gun Girls' (1999) which Pavement has described as ""An unsettling mixture of Japanese school-girl eroticism, fifties ray-guns and haunting landscapes""."""

Shackleton was born in Waimate, New Zealand, in 1901. She was educated at Waimate District High School, Columba College in Dunedin, and Canterbury University College in Christchurch. She graduated with a Diploma of Journalism in 1928 and her first job was as a reporter on the daily newspaper the Christchurch Star. Shackleton reported on court news, however she resigned her position after a judge ordered her to leave the courtroom due to the ""unsavoury"" nature of the case under discussion. Instead, she travelled overseas and wrote travel articles until returning to the Christchurch Star in 1930 as assistant to the editor. She held this position for five years, and was responsible for the leader page, editorials, a column and a feature titled ""A Woman's Point of View"". At the time, this was the highest position a woman had reached on a major New Zealand daily paper. In the 1930s, Shackleton was the founding president of the Christchurch Business and Professional Women's Round Table Club. In 1936 Shackleton became a freelance parliamentary reporter, and reported on parliament from the segregated public gallery. Her column was syndicated in the four main centres of the country (Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin). In 1939 Shackleton returned to Waimate to care for her elderly parents, and during World War II she was secretary of the Waimate Women's War Service Auxiliary, the Lady Galway Guild and the local commander of the Women's Transport Corps. She was also a founding member of the Waimate Rewi Alley Aid Committee, which was formed to fundraise and provide support for Alley's work in China. After the war she became interested in international aid and began to work for the non-profit organisation Corso. In 1949 she became publicity officer for their national office. In 1965, plans to close the local hospital in Waimate were raised, and Shackleton stood for, and was elected to, the South Canterbury Hospital Board. The Waimate Hospital Committee asked her to write a history of the hospital for its centennial, thus in 1984, at the age of 83, she published a book on the history of Waimate Hospital from 1874 to 1975, The Fifth Schedule. It is considered a significant work on the place of small hospitals in the New Zealand health system. In the 1986 New Year Honours, she was awarded the Queens Service Medal for her work as a journalist and her involvement with Corso, women's affairs and local body affairs.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blair_Hartland	"""Blair Robert Hartland (born 22 October 1966, in Christchurch, Canterbury) is a former New Zealand cricketer who played nine Tests and 16 One Day Internationals for New Zealand. He also played 11 seasons of domestic cricket for Canterbury, playing 83 first class and 68 List A games in total, Hartland also held the record for the most runs in a one-day domestic match, until it was broken by Brendan McCullum. He was a specialist batsman, who usually opened the innings and bowled a total of three overs in his senior career. The son of former Canterbury cricketer, Ian Hartland, he was also a very talented hockey player. A product of Christchurch Boys' High School, Hartland was marked out as a talent early on, and aged 19 he was picked for the New Zealand Young Cricketers, who toured Australia in 1985Ð86. The following season he made his first class debut, playing one game for Canterbury in a drawn domestic game. He made 59 runs for once out, retiring injured in the second innings, and did not return in that season. He also played two seasons of second XI cricket for Northamptonshire in 1987 and 1988, and in 1988Ð89 Hartland hit his maiden first class century, in his fourteenth match. Hartland became a regular fixture in the Canterbury first-class team after that, playing 10 of 11 games in the 1990Ð91 season, for example. The following season, he was picked as an opening batsman for New Zealand Emerging Players (similar to the current New Zealand A team) against a touring England XI. Though Hartland faced 36 balls in his two innings, he only made one run for twice out, but that didn't prevent the New Zealand selectors from selecting him for the first Test at his native Christchurch two weeks later, as New Zealand sought a replacement for the defensive opener Trevor Franklin who had opened on tour of Sri Lanka a year earlier. However, Hartland's debut did not yield a good result for New Zealand. England were put in to bat, made 580 for nine declared, before spin bowler Phil Tufnell took eleven wickets in the match, including Hartland twice, for 22 in the first innings and then 45 in the second when stumps were drawn on day four. Hartland watched as Tufnell added a further six victims in the second innings, and England secured a victory by an innings and four runs. Hartland was retained for the second Test, however, and recorded a pair of ducks as New Zealand went down by 168 runs Ð before scoring 2 in New Zealand's first innings of the third Test where the team made 432 for 9 declared after a stand of 241 between John Wright and Andrew Jones. Hartland had still not passed fifty in six Test innings, but was still taken on tours of Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka in 1992Ð93, and though he did not play a Test against Zimbabwe (with Mark Greatbatch and Rod Latham preferred as openers), he played his first ODI on that tour, scoring five runs from number three in the batting order as New Zealand won by four wickets. Greatbatch and Latham were dropped for Sri Lanka, however, and Hartland was back as opener together with Wright; after he was out to Dulip Liyanage for 3 in the first innings, and Sri Lanka had declared 39 runs ahead with five sessions remaining, Hartland batted for four hours in an opening stand worth 110 with Wright, making his maiden Test fifty. New Zealand batted out the match, making 195 for 5 the second innings in a drawn game. That was enough for Hartland to be picked for the second Test a week later, where he made the second highest score of New Zealand's innings. However, that was only 21, as New Zealand fell from 57 for 0 to 102 all out; following on, Hartland made 21 again as New Zealand made 361, but Sri Lanka took a nine-wicket win and the series by 1Ð0. Hartland also played two of the three ODIs in the series, recording his maiden ODI fifty, but New Zealand still lost both matches and the series 0Ð2. Hartland also played New Zealand's next Test, a home match against Pakistan, but after he once again failed to pass 50 and made 9 in a second-innings chase of 127 to win, where New Zealand were bowled out for 93 by Wasim Akram (five for 45) and Waqar Younis (five for 22) he was dropped and did not play international matches for over a year. When he did return, it was once again against Pakistan, scoring 13 runs in two innings in a five-wicket win for New Zealand. He continued to feature in the New Zealand side for the remainder of the 1993Ð94 season, making 68 not out in a successful chase of 146 in a One Day International against Pakistan, but otherwise not passing 25 in one Test and seven One Day Internationals. Hartland was, however, picked for New Zealand's tour of England in 1994; he played nine matches against first-class sides of the country, but only one Test, his last. Hartland made 6 and 22 in an innings defeat, and was replaced by Blair Pocock in the next match. He played a further five ODIs during the 1994Ð95 season, but after five scores below 50 he was dropped after the Mandela Trophy. He played a further two seasons for Canterbury before retiring. Hartland is married to Nicki and has three children: Emma born 1995 (age 21Ð22), Tessa born 1997 (age 19Ð20), and Benjamin born 1999 (age 17Ð18)."""	Blair Hartland

He was part of the New Zealand team that toured England in 1986, but never played a Test or ODI. Barrett's first-class debut came for Worcestershire against Cambridge University in June 1985; in a drawn match in which little play was possible, he took the single wicket of Shaun Gorman and did not bat.He only ever made one further first-team appearance for the county, when he took 0-43 in eight overs and scored 5 not out against Gloucestershire in a John Player League match at Moreton-in-Marsh near the end of the season. Returning to New Zealand, he appeared three times for Auckland in the 1985-86 Shell Trophy, collecting five wickets in his first game against Canterbury;he then played several times for New Zealand Young Cricketers against their touring Australian counterparts, making five Youth Test and two Youth ODI appearances, although without any startling success. Back in England for 1986, he was unable to break into the Worcestershire first team, but in July and August he turned out a number of times for the touring New Zealanders, though without gaining any international honours or indeed more than three wickets in any innings.

He passed most of his boyhood at the Thames, and after leaving school went to the Northern Wairoa district, where he took to a bushman's life. His work in the kauri bushes was varied by an occasional spell as a boatman on the river, and so he got his first lessons in rowing. For three years he was in the service of the Hon. E. Mitchelson, at Dargaville, and during that time got a good deal of rough practice in rowing. His first race was rowed, with J. Wilson as a partner, in the pairs at the Wairoa Regatta in April 1887. Their principal opponents were the Brothers Brown, who were recognised at the time as the ""bosses"" of the river. To the surprise of everyone young Stephenson and his mate won easily. The Browns were not satisfied with their defeat, and a match was made with their conquerors for £50 a-side, to come off a month after the regatta. This had the same result, and Stephenson's reputation began to grow. In January 1888, he was one of the Northern Wairoa Whaleboat Crew which finished third at Auckland Anniversary Regatta. Waitemata winning and North Shore rowing second. After this he went back to the bush; but in November 1888, he and two friends left the Wairoa, intending to go to Tasmania. Stephenson, however, got no further than Sydney, where he determined to try his luck as a professional sculler. The Spencer Brothers, who brought out Searle and Matterson, finding that he gave good promise, took him 'up' and backed him against Joe Kemp, brother of the ex-champion, for £100 a-side. The match was rowed over the Parramatta course on 30 August 1889, and resulted in a three lengths win for Stephenson, the time for the first mile being 5min 43sec, and the full distance being rowed in 20min 24.5sec. On 30 October 1889 Stephenson sustained a defeat by John McLean, who beat him by three lengths, after a good race, over the same course, in 21min 53sec. For this match Stephenson was backed by Mr Warby, of Sydney, who was his chief supporter for a match for the Championship of New Zealand. His opponent was William Hearn. Stephenson was thus, as compared with his opponent, a novice sculler but he won by three lengths in a time of 22min 22.75sec. The race was run in Wellington on 5 February 1890.Stephenson next defended his title against Tom Sullivan on the Parramatta River, Sydney on 11 May 1891. The stake was £100 a side.

As Director of Medical and Health Services of Hong Kong, preventing and controlling infectious diseases had become his prime objective. When the territory was twice hit by cholera outbreaks between August and October 1961 and 1962, he adopted a number of effective emergency measures to combat the disease, such as to set up a temporary cholera hospital and a quarantine station-cum-isolation camp, and more importantly, set up a large number of vaccination points in the territory to urge the public to receive free vaccinations. Besides, to satisfy the ever-growing demand, he rapidly expanded the public health system by constructing a number of large-scale hospitals and public health facilities including the North Wing of Kwong Wah Hospital and Queen Elizabeth Hospital.

He is currently the head coach of the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and the Brisbane Heat in the Big Bash league. He was the captain of New Zealand between 2007 and 2011. Vettori is the eighth player in Test history to take 300 wickets and score 3,000 runs. He is the youngest player to have represented New Zealand in Test cricket, having made his debut in 1996Ð97 at the age of 18, and New Zealand's most-capped test cricketer with 112 caps, and New Zealand's most capped One-Day cricketer with 284 caps. Vettori was a bowling all-rounder who bowled slow left-arm orthodox spin; he is known for his accuracy, flight and guile rather than prodigious turn, and also his speed variation. He has a Test batting average of around 30 which made him one of the more consistent batsmen in the New Zealand cricket team. In the fourth season of Indian Premier League, he was contracted by Royal Challengers Bangalore for US$550,000. He was born in Auckland and brought up in Hamilton, attending Marian School and later St. Paul's Collegiate School. When available, he plays provincial cricket for Northern Districts and is also an international member of Indian Premier League team the Royal Challengers Bangalore. Vettori also represents the Brisbane Heat in the Big Bash League. He is among a very small minority of international sports stars to wear prescription spectacles while playing sport, and only one of very few cricketers in the modern era to play Test cricket with spectacles, others including Zimbabwean Charles Coventry, Australian Chris Rogers, and West Indian Clive Lloyd. Vettori announced his retirement from all forms of international cricket following the 2015 Cricket World Cup. On April 2, 2015, Vettori signed a 3-year contract to become head coach of Brisbane Heat, effectively ending his playing career in all forms of the game."""	Daniel Luca Vettori

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Danny_Morrison_(cricketer)	"""Daniel Kyle Morrison (born 3 February 1966) is a former New Zealand cricketer (Black Caps). He specialised as a pace bowler with a useful outswinger. He made his test debut for New Zealand in 1987 at the age of 21 against Australia. His most notable bowling accomplishment occurred on 25 March 1994, when he took a hat-trick in a One Day International (ODI) against India. He is one of only two New Zealanders and twenty-one players worldwide to have taken an ODI hat-trick. He is fondly remembered by his fans for his big grin and his unique bowling action. During the final stride of the delivery his bowling arm used to displace air behind the umpire in such a manner that it would make umpireÕs shirt flutter. Morrison's most notable ""accomplishment"" as a batsman is that he once held the world record for Test ducks. Of the 48 Tests he played, he was dismissed without scoring in 24 innings. Morrison was often subjected to good natured ridicule regarding this from his teammates and the general public due to his feeble efforts. This went as far as a tie being manufactured in 1996 featuring numerous ducks to celebrate his world record. He is sometimes referred to as ""The Duckman"" (see List of nicknames used in cricket) and also launched a duck caller for hunters on the back of his record. The duck callers were not very successful. However, he did have some batting prowess. His most famous innings was when he contributed 14 in a 106-run partnership with Nathan Astle for the tenth wicket against England, to save the match. This occurred in his final test appearance for the national team on 28 January 1997. He was dropped from the team after the match."""	Danny Morrison

Over a period of about forty years artist Dean Buchanan has continually put his distinct and dynamic view of New Zealand landscape on canvas and hessian.

His effort ""ignited controversy of a scale, visibility, and ferocity never before seen in anthropology."" Freeman initially became interested in Boasian cultural anthropology while an undergraduate in Wellington, and later went to live and work as a teacher in Samoa. After entering the New Zealand Naval Reserve in World War II, he did graduate training with British social anthropologists Meyer Fortes and Raymond Firth at London School of Economics. He did two and a half years of fieldwork in Borneo studying the Iban people. His 1953 doctoral dissertation described the relations between Iban agriculture and kinship practices. Returning to Borneo in 1961 he suffered a nervous breakdown induced by an intense rivalry with ethnologist and explorer Tom Harrisson. This experience profoundly altered his view of anthropology, changing his interests to looking at the ways in which human behavior is influenced by universal psychological and biological foundations. From then on Freeman argued strongly for a new approach to anthropology which integrated insights from evolutionary theory and psychoanalysis, and he published works on the concepts of aggression and choice. This new interest in biological and psychological universals lead him to take issue with the famous American anthropologist Margaret Mead who had described Samoan adolescents as not suffering from the ""coming of age"" crisis which was commonly thought to be universal when the study was published in 1923. Mead argued that the lack of this crisis in Samoan adolescence was caused by the youths' greater degree of sexual freedom, and that adolescence crises were therefore not universal, but culturally conditioned. In 1966-67 Freeman conducted fieldwork in Samoa, trying to find Mead's original informants, and while visiting the community where Mead had worked he experienced another breakdown. In 1983 Freeman published his book Margaret Mead and Samoa: The Making and Unmaking of an Anthropological Myth in which he argued that Mead's data and conclusions were wrong and that Samoan youths suffered from the same problems as Western adolescents. He also argued that Samoan culture in fact put greater emphasis on female virginity than Western culture and had higher indices of juvenile delinquency, sexual violence and suicide. He later published ""The Fateful Hoaxing of Margaret Mead"" in which he argued that Mead's misunderstandings of Samoan culture were due to her having been hoaxed by two of her female Samoan informants, who had merely joked about sexual escapades that they did not in fact have. Freeman's critique of Mead sparked intense debate and controversy in the discipline of anthropology, as well as in the general public. Many of Freeman's critics argued that he misrepresented Mead's views and ignored changes in Samoan society that had taken place in the period between Mead's work in 1925-1926 and his own from 1941-1943, including an increasing influence of Christianity. Generally, Freeman's critique has not been accepted in the anthropological community. Several Samoan scholars who had been discontent with Mead's depiction of them as happy and sexually liberated thought that Freeman erred in the opposite direction. But Freeman's arguments were embraced enthusiastically among scholars who prefer an evolutionary approach to the study of human behavior, such as that taken in the fields of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology. The debate made Freeman a celebrity both inside and outside of anthropology, to an extent that in 1996 Freeman's life became the topic of the play Heretic written by Australian playwright David Williamson, which opened in the Sydney Opera House. The so-called Mead-Freeman controversy spanned three decades, and Freeman published his last rebuttal of a critique of his arguments only weeks before his death in 2001."""	Derek Freeman

He has also played in the groups Orb, Space Waltz, Crowded House, The Makers and 801. Rayner has released two solo albums. The first, Horse, was an instrumental offering released in 1995, recorded entirely at Rayner's home studio in Melbourne, Australia. The second was entitled Play it Straight, a play on a Philip Judd Split Enz song called Play it Strange that was a particular favourite of Rayner's during the mid- to late-1970s. The song never made an album, but was played live when Judd rejoined the band in 1977. Play it Straight consisted of re-arranged and re-recorded versions of material gleaned from other New Zealand composers. Rayner's keyboard talents were a notable part of the Split Enz sound. Paul McCartney caught one of their shows in 1979 and became a fan of the band, eventually inviting Rayner to play keyboards on his sixth solo album, Press to Play, which was released in 1986. Rayner has also produced material for many artists including Models, Margaret Urlich, Maggot Smith, and The Exponents, as well as two Enzso recordings with Split Enz members, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra. During the late 1990s Eddie Rayner decided to take the Split Enz songs to an orchestral setting. This sparked the idea for the Enzso project. Along with his synth, the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, some Newland Singers and some of his old mates from Split Enz, he created orchestral versions for Split Enz songs. The project ended between late 1999 and early 2000. Recently he has acted as Musical Director for television show New Zealand Idol, and participated in reunions of Split Enz and Space Waltz.

Born in New Zealand but reared in London, Gorst attended Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1885 he became both a barrister and a member of the British diplomatic corps, going to Egypt the following year as controller of direct taxes, becoming undersecretary for finance (1892), adviser to the Interior Ministry (1894), and financial adviser (1898). In 1904 he returned to London where, as undersecretary of state, he effectively represented Lord Cromer in the Foreign Office. After the Liberal Party came to power, the British government sent Gorst to replace Cromer with instructions to give Egyptians greater responsibility to manage their internal affairs. As British Agent and Consul General in Egypt, Gorst quickly improved the Agency's relationship with Khedive Abbas Hilmi II, brought more Egyptians into responsible government positions, and weakened the Egyptian National Party. However, his efforts to rein in the burgeoning corps of Anglo-Egyptian officials offended many old Egypt hands. The appointment of Boutros Ghali as prime minister, popularly ascribed to Gorst, angered the Nationalists and many other Egyptians, leading to press attacks and eventually to Boutros Ghali's assassination. The revival of the Press Law in 1909 alienated Europeans as well as Egyptians and proved unenforceable. Gorst's attempt to extend the Suez Canal Company's concession in 1909-1910 to raise additional funds for development in Egypt and the Sudan was disliked by all Egyptians; when he put the issue to the Egyptian General Assembly, vehement opposition from the Nationalist press led to its rejection. This rejection, together with the murder of Boutros Ghali, caused Gorst to abandon his lenient policy in favor of a harsher one, using the Exceptional Laws and various penal measures to stifle the Nationalists. He had almost restored British control when he became stricken with cancer and went back to England to die. An unprepossessing and egotistical man, disliked by the older British colonial administrators in Egypt and distrusted by the Egyptians as sphinxlike, Gorst was never accorded the respect that his intelligence and strong will warranted, although he received the Grand Cordons of the Osmanieh and Mejidiye Orders and was a Knight Commander of Sts.

Geoff Rabone played for Wellington from 1940-41 to 1950-51 and for Auckland from 1951-52 to 1959-60 as a dour right-handed batsman and as a right-arm off-break bowler who bowled the occasional leg-break too. He represented New Zealand in 12 Test matches between 1949 and the 1954-55 seasons and he was the South African Cricketer of the Year in 1954. After Second World War service as a Lancaster bomber pilot, Rabone had played only six first-class matches before being selected for 1949 New Zealand touring side to England. In a team of strokemakers headed by Martin Donnelly and Bert Sutcliffe, Rabone's normal batting style gave solidity to New Zealand's middle order. He played in all four Tests of the summer, making 148 runs but with a highest score of just 39. His maiden century came on this tour as well: he made an unbeaten 120 against Nottinghamshire, opening the innings and batting for 340 minutes in a total of 329 for four declared. On the tour as a whole, he made 1,021 runs at an average of 32.93. His bowling proved expensive in English conditions, and he took 50 wickets, but at an average of 35.70. In the Tests, he took only four wickets. In his next Test series, when the West Indies visited New Zealand in 1951-52, Rabone continued to be used primarily as a defensive batsman, taking 178 minutes to acore 37 as an opener, and then 83 minutes to score just nine in the middle order. And the following year, playing just one match when South Africa toured New Zealand, he took 215 minutes to score 29. In 1953-54, New Zealand made its first Test-playing tour to a country other than England, a five-Test series in South Africa. Rabone was picked as captain, and though the side was unsuccessful in the big matches Ð the Test series was lost 4-0 Ð his own reputation for dependability and durability was enhanced. In the first Test, he made 107 out of a total of 230 in more than six hours, and followed that with 68 out of 149 in the second innings. In all, he batted for 585 out of the 675 minutes that his side's two innings lasted. That match was lost by an innings; the second, in which Rabone had little success, was lost by 132 runs. But the third game, which ended as a draw, saw New Zealand's then-highest Test score, 505, and the first time the team had managed to enforce the follow-on. Rabone not only scored 56, but then took six wickets for 68 runs as South Africa were bowled out for 326, his best Test bowling. The tour ended in an anticlimax for Rabone, though, as he broke a bone in a foot during a provincial match and could not take part in the last two Tests. Rabone was restored to the New Zealand captaincy the following year for the 1954-55 MCC tour of New Zealand. The results in the two Tests were poor and there was criticism of his captaincy, but Rabone's own adhesive qualities seemed undiminished. In the first innings of the first match, he was one of only two players Ð the other was Sutcliffe Ð to reach double figures, taking three hours to score 18.

As Prime Minister she served three consecutive terms from 1999 to 2008 and was the first woman elected at a general election as the Prime Minister, and was the fifth longest serving person to hold that office. She has been Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme, the third-highest UN position, since 2009. In April 2016, she declared her candidacy for the position of Secretary-General of the United Nations. Clark graduated from the University of Auckland in 1974 and became politically active in the New Zealand Labour Party as a teenager. While a junior lecturer at the University in the early 1970s, Clark entered local politics in 1974 in Auckland but was not elected to any position. In 1975 she came second for Labour in the rural (and safe National) seat of Piako. In 1981 she was elected to Parliament for the safe Labour seat of Mount Albert, a position she held until her resignation in 2009. Clark held numerous Cabinet positions in the Fourth Labour government of 1984Ð1990, including Minister of Housing, Minister of Health and Minister of Conservation. She was Deputy Prime Minister from 1989Ð1990 under Prime Ministers Geoffrey Palmer and Mike Moore. After Labour's strong showing in the 1993 election, Clark challenged the Labour leadership of Mike Moore and won, becoming the Leader of the Opposition. After failing to win the 1996 election, she led the Labour Party to a sweeping victory in the 1999 election. As Prime Minister of the Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand, Clark's government presided over nearly a decade of economic growth, while still maintaining a large government surplus. Clark's government implemented several major economic initiatives including Kiwibank, the New Zealand Superannuation Fund, the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme and KiwiSaver. Her government's other major policies included the Working for Families package, increasing the minimum wage 5% a year, interest-free student loans, creation of District Health Boards, the introduction of a number of tax credits, overhauling the secondary school qualifications by introducing NCEA, and the introduction of fourteen weeksÕ parental leave. Her government also introduced the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004 which caused major controversy and was eventually repealed in 2011. Clark sent troops to the Afghanistan War, but did not contribute combat troops to the Iraq War although some medical and engineering units were sent. Her agenda reflected the priorities of liberal internationalism, especially the promotion of democracy and human rights; the strengthening of the role of the United Nations; the advancement of antimilitarism and disarmament; and the encouragement of free trade. Clark advocated a number of free trade agreements with major trading partners, including becoming the first developed nation to sign such an agreement with China, and ordered a military deployment to the 2006 East Timorese crisis alongside international partners. Her government was defeated in the 2008 election and she resigned as Prime Minister and Labour Party leader. She resigned from Parliament in April 2009 from her Mount Albert electorate and was replaced by David Shearer to take up the post of Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Key	"""John Phillip Key (born 9 August 1961) is the 38th Prime Minister of New Zealand, in office since 2008. He has led the New Zealand National Party since 2006. Born in Auckland before moving to Christchurch when he was a child, Key attended the University of Canterbury and graduated in 1981 with a bachelor of commerce. He began a career in the foreign exchange market in New Zealand before moving overseas to work for Merrill Lynch, in which he became head of global foreign exchange in 1995, a position he would hold for six years. In 1999 he was appointed a member of the Foreign Exchange Committee of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York until leaving in 2001. Key entered the New Zealand Parliament representing the Auckland electorate of Helensville as one of the few new National members of parliament in the election of 2002 following National's significant defeat of that year. He has held the seat since then. In 2004, he was appointed Finance Spokesman for National and eventually succeeded Don Brash as the National Party leader in 2006. After two years as Leader of the Opposition, Key led his party to victory at the November 2008 general election, and repeated this feat at both the November 2011 general election and September 2014 general election. As Prime Minister, Key leads the Fifth National Government of New Zealand which entered government at the beginning of the late-2000s recession in 2008. In his first term, Key's government implemented a GST rise and personal tax cuts. In February 2011, a major earthquake in Christchurch, the nation's second largest city, significantly affected the national economy and the government formed the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority in response. In its second term, Key's government announced a policy of partial privatisation of five state-owned enterprises; while the policy was enacted, voters in a citizens-initiated referendum on the issue were 2 to 1 opposed to the policy. In foreign policy, Key announced the withdrawal of New Zealand Defence Force personnel from their deployment in the war in Afghanistan, signed the Wellington Declaration with the United States and pushed for more nations to join the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership."""

He has also scored over 10,000 runs in List A limited overs cricket. He typically opened for New Zealand, and was noted as a tenacious, rather than spectacular, batsman. His team nickname was ""shake""; reputedly a reflection on his packing technique. Together with Bruce Edgar of Wellington, he formed what was arguably New Zealand's most successful and reliable opening partnership. During a match against Australia in 1980, he became the second player in history to score an eight off one ball in a Test, running four and collecting four overthrows. Toward the end of his career he used an unorthodox batting stance; whereas most batsman face the bowler with the bat in line with their legs, and perpendicular to the ground, Wright would stand with his bat raised in parallel to it.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Wright_(cricketer)	"""John Geoffrey Wright, MBE (born 5 July 1954), is a former international cricketer representing Ð and captaining Ð New Zealand, and, following his retirement in 1993, coaching the Indian national cricket team from 2000 to 2005. He made his international debut in 1978 against England. During his career, he scored over 5,000 Test runs (the first New Zealand Test player to do so) at an average of 37.82 runs per dismissal with 12 Test centuries, 10 of them in New Zealand. He also played for Derbyshire in England. In first-class cricket he scored over 25,000 runs, having scored over 50 first-class centuries. He has also scored over 10,000 runs in List A limited overs cricket. He typically opened for New Zealand, and was noted as a tenacious, rather than spectacular, batsman. His team nickname was ""shake""; reputedly a reflection on his packing technique. Together with Bruce Edgar of Wellington, he formed what was arguably New Zealand's most successful and reliable opening partnership. During a match against Australia in 1980, he became the second player in history to score an eight off one ball in a Test, running four and collecting four overthrows. Toward the end of his career he used an unorthodox batting stance; whereas most batsman face the bowler with the bat in line with their legs, and perpendicular to the ground, Wright would stand with his bat raised in parallel to it. After retiring, Wright worked in sales for around two years Ð self-confessedly without great success.

Gibbes traditionally plays at the position of Blindside Flanker, or No.6, but has also played at Lock.

Weighing in at 109 kg, Gibbes's career has been plagued by injury. Nonetheless his line-out jumping skills are more than impressive and under the guidance of John Mitchell was selected as captain of the Waikato NPC team in 2003. Despite various appearances for the All Blacks, Gibbes highest career achievement was captaining the NZ Maori to their first ever victory over the British Lions 19Ð13. During the match, which was played at Waikato and Chiefs home ground of Waikato Stadium, Gibbes was on the ground clearly suffering from cramp but miraculously staggered to his feet to make a try-saving tackle. On 13 June 2006, it was announced that Gibbes would be joining the Ospreys in Wales. On 6 September 2006 however, the NZRU and Waikato announced that he has signed a new three-year contract with them.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Burnett	"""Karl Burnett (born 27 February 1976) is a New Zealand actor best known for his portrayal of Nick Harrison on the long-running New Zealand soap opera, Shortland Street. Burnett was 16 years old when offered the role of Nick Harrison on Shortland Street in 1992. The then Massey High School student had little acting experience, other than high-school drama classes, though after six years of starring on Shortland Street he had a part in the 1998 film When Love Comes. He played the role of Nick Harrison from the show's second episode in 1992 until the character's departure in 2005, making Nick Harrison the original character to stay with the show the longest. Nick Harrison was originally intended as a drug-taking rebel, but after Burnett was cast, the role was developed into a more comedic and clumsy character. In 2005, after 13 years on the show, the character of Nick was axed by producers. Later in 2005, Burnett appeared in TV3's celebrity singing competition Sing Like a Superstar. Burnett went on to work as a boom operator on Shortland Street and a freelance sound recordist. In 2008 Burnett appeared on the weight-loss reality show Downsize Me. He initially weighed 120 kg, losing 20 kg over the course of the programme. That year he also published a comic novel The Bible II: This Way Up Ð Rick the Chosen One. In 2010 he released the independent film Captain Amazingly Incredible and the Space Vampires from the Evil Planet!!!, which he wrote, directed, and starred in. The film was self-described as ""the lowest selling movie in the history of ... the [film's] distributor."" Burnett has also released several video games for mobile platforms, including Get Gravel!, Codestorm, Project Downforce and Max Vector: Resolution. Having previously studied interactive videogame development at Media Design School in Auckland, Burnett won the 2011 Sidhe Elite scholarship award.

A wicket-keeper and a useful batsman, James first played for Wellington in 1923 and came to England with the first New Zealand touring party in 1927 ostensibly as second string to Tom Lowry. But he quickly made the wicket-keeping position his own, with 85 dismissals on the tour, including eight at Derby. His understanding of the spin of Bill Merritt, the touring team's most successful bowler, was especially noted. No Test matches were played on the 1927 tour. James was first-choice wicket-keeper for New Zealand's first Test matches in 1929-30 against England, and again on the tour of England in 1931, and in the home series against South Africa in 1931-32 and against England the following season. In 11 Tests he made 16 dismissals but failed completely as a batsman, scoring only 52 runs in total. But James then left New Zealand for England to qualify by residence as a county player for Northamptonshire, becoming the regular wicket-keeper from 1936 to 1939 and being joined there by Merritt. For a very weak county Ñ Northamptonshire failed to win a single match for four years from May 1935 Ñ James was notable not only for his wicket-keeping but also increasingly as a batsman, and in 1938, he scored more than 1,000 runs and made two centuries. James served in the Royal New Zealand Air Force during the Second World War and then returned to New Zealand, where he played a few more first-class matches before retiring to run a public house.

He is best known for his work at King's College London on the structure of DNA which falls into two distinct phases. The first was in 1948Ð50 where his initial studies produced the first clear X-ray images of DNA which he presented at a conference in Naples in 1951 attended by James Watson. During the second phase of work (1951Ð52) he produced clear ""B form"" ""X"" shaped images from squid sperm which he sent to James Watson and Francis Crick causing Watson to write ""Wilkins... has obtained extremely excellent X-ray diffraction photographs"" [of DNA]. In 1953, Wilkins' colleague Rosalind Franklin instructed Raymond Gosling to hand over a high quality image of ""B"" form DNA (Photo 51), which she had made in 1952 but had Òput it asideÓ, to Wilkins as she was leaving King's College London. Wilkins imprudently showed it to Watson. This image, along with the knowledge that Linus Pauling had proposed an incorrect structure of DNA, ÒmobilisedÓ Watson and Crick to restart model building. With additional information from research reports of Wilkins and Franklin (obtained via Max Perutz), Watson and Crick correctly described the double-helix structure of DNA in 1953. Wilkins continued to test, verify and make significant corrections to the Watson-Crick model and to study the structure of RNA.

He was born at Taihape, Manawatu, New Zealand. The son of Henry Basil Melvin Groves, an Englishman whose single first-class cricket appearance came in India, Mike Groves was born in New Zealand but brought up in South Africa, where he was educated at Diocesan College, Cape Town. Usually a right-handed middle-order batsman and irregular right-arm medium-pace bowler, he played a single match as an 18-year-old in 1960/61 for Western Province as an opening batsman, scoring 5 and 45. He then came to England and played occasional amateur first-class matches in 1962 before going to Oxford University in autumn 1962 as an undergraduate at St Edmund Hall. Over the next four cricket seasons, Groves played regularly for Oxford University's first eleven cricket team, but in 1963, despite finishing fourth in the university's batting averages with 485 runs at an average of 26.94 runs per innings, he was left out of the team for the University Match and did not win a Blue. His highest score in the season was an unbeaten 74 in the match against Northamptonshire. In 1964, he failed to match either the aggregate or the average, and his only score of 50 or more for the season was 61, but he retained his place through the Oxford season and was awarded a Blue, scoring eight and 10 not out and taking a single wicket, that of Richard Hutton, in the match. Groves played his single full season of first-class cricket in 1965 and had his best year, with 1048 runs at an average of 29.11. He topped the Oxford batting averages with 743 runs at an average of 32.30 and made 69 and 81, his highest score for the university, in the match against Sussex which came immediately before the University Match. In the University Match itself, Groves top-scored for Oxford with 45 in the first innings, but he and fellow batsman Melville Guest were barracked by the crowd for slow scoring, with 15 consecutive maiden overs bowled by the two Cambridge spinners. The slow scoring was uncharacteristic, though Wisden noted that, in an out-of-form batting side and on damp pitches, Groves had not been able in 1965 to bat with the freedom he'd exhibited in previous seasons. After the university term was over, he joined Somerset, and though he began in the second team, for the whole of August he played for the first team, and while there he compiled the highest score of his first-class career, 86, in the match against Derbyshire at Glastonbury. Groves returned for a fourth season at Oxford in 1966 but played only four matches because of examination demands. One of those, however, was his third University Match, and after five consecutive drawn games in this fixture the 1966 match was won by an innings by Oxford, with Groves' unbeaten 80 in 98 minutes on the first day one of the batting highlights, enabling Oxford to declare and give Cambridge an awkward half hour's batting at the end of the day. After the game, Groves again joined Somerset, but this time he played only a handful of second eleven matches and did not feature in the first team, which was having one of its most successful seasons.

He also has been known to ""take a business approach to philanthropy."" Chandler was formerly CEO of the Sovereign group of companies, in partnership with his brother, Christopher Chandler. Between 1986 and 2006, Sovereign invested in companies and governments in Asia, Africa, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and in industries including telecommunications, electric utilities, steel, oil and gas, banking and oil refining. The brothers split their assets in 2007 with Richard Chandler creating Orient Global and Christopher Chandler starting Legatum Capital. Richard's investment style has been described as deep value investing, primarily in global emerging markets and especially in distress situations. Orient Global changed its name to Richard Chandler Corporation in April 2010 before becoming the Chandler Corporation in 2013, and the Clermont Group in 2016. The company ""is a long-term value investor that believes well-governed companies play a fundamental role in creating national prosperity,"" according to its website. Richard Chandler's business ventures have been tinged with themes of contrarian investment, corporate governance and social responsibility, especially by investing in and managing companies with national socio-economic implications. He once told Institutional Investor, ""We do have altruistic motives that some investors who are looking for a path of least resistance find hard to understand, but we donÕt want to be defined by our corporate governance battles. We are value investors with a sense of responsibility, not activists."" The Chandler brothers were involved in a highly publicized incident in 2005. Sovereign sold its investment in South Korea's SK Corp., at the time South Korea's third-largest oil conglomerate, after the board refused to oust chairman and CEO Chey Tae Won. Chey had been convicted of accounting fraud for illegally trading stocks. Sovereign had invested in the company just after Chey's arrest, hoping to turn it around. Richard Chandler and his brother tried twice unsuccessfully to remove Chey and ultimately pulled out for ethical reasons. By that point they had improved the company and profited US$728 million. In 2007 Richard Chandler launched a US$100 million education initiative in the developing world with the focus to build low-cost private education opportunities in India. Furthermore, he invested in a global chain of international K-12 schools called Nobel Education Network. Multiple media outlets reported in 2012 that Chandler considered investing in the Tasmanian logging company, Gunns, but ultimately decided not to. Yahoo Finance reported in June 2013 that Chandler's company acquired an 80% stake in Hoan My Medical Corporation, Vietnam's largest private hospital group. According to the article's author, the transaction ""complements the healthcare businesses the Chandler Corporation owns and operates in Indonesia and the Philippines, positioning it to become a leading private healthcare provider in Asia."""""

For this reason the authorities dealt with her work harshly, with the police removing some of her work from exhibitions, confiscating books that contained her images, and attempting to prosecute her for public obscenity on a number of occasions. According to her later biographer, Nevill Drury, ""Norton's esoteric beliefs, cosmology and visionary art are all closely intertwined Ð and reflect her unique approach to the magical universe.""

These caused particular controversy in Australia during the 1940s and 50s, when the country ""was both socially and politically conservative"" with Christianity as the dominant faith and at a time when the government ""promoted a harsh stance on censorship."" For this reason the authorities dealt with her work harshly, with the police removing some of her work from exhibitions, confiscating books that contained her images, and attempting to prosecute her for public obscenity on a number of occasions. According to her later biographer, Nevill Drury, ""Norton's esoteric beliefs, cosmology and visionary art are all closely intertwined Ð and reflect her unique approach to the magical universe."" She was inspired by ""the 'night' side of magic"", emphasising darkness and studying the Qliphoth, alongside forms of sex magic which she had learned from the writings of English occultist Aleister Crowley."""

The daughter of Alex Wood the Chief Reporter of the now defunct Auckland Star. Wood began her career in journalism in 1979 as a print reporter for the Bay of Plenty Times before moving on to The New Zealand Herald in Auckland to work as the court and then police reporter. She began her career with TVNZ in 1985 as a reporter for the then-network news (simply called News) and the regional news show Top Tux. She was the first Australia correspondent for ONE Network News. Wood also hosted the lifestyle series' Open Home and New Zealand Living, was Paul Holmes' regular fill-in on Holmes (in some years, the credits were altered to show Holmes with Susan Wood as the title), presented Frontline and Assignment and was the original presenter of Midday and Breakfast. She co-presented Breakfast with Mike Hosking for two-and-a-half years until she left the early-morning show to host Today Live, which ran for two years. On 2 November 2004 Paul Holmes resigned from TVNZ and announced he was moving to a rival TV company, Prime Television. The Holmes show ended immediately and was replaced by a new current affairs show, Close Up, which was the same as Holmes in format, with Susan Wood as the new host. In 2005 Wood took her employer TVNZ to court after the broadcaster attempted to cut more than $100,000 from her salary. Wood won the case, and in 2006 returned as Close Up's presenter. On 4 December 2006 Wood announced her resignation from TVNZ for health reasons. TVNZ said that for the previous few weeks, Wood's health had been a matter for serious concern. She had surgery in mid-December 2006 to remove a lump from her neck following an inconclusive biopsy. Wood took a job as General Manager of the Takapuna Beach Business Association in October 2007, but left a week later saying that it did not have the funding to achieve what she wanted for Takapuna. She now hosts the TVNZ current affairs program Q&A. She works as a backup talkshow host on popular radio station Newstalk ZB.

Born in Otakou, Otago Heads, Ellison was educated at Te Aute College, where he was introduced to rugby. After moving to Wellington, Ellison played for the Poneke Football Club, and was selected to play for Wellington province. He was recruited into Joe Warbrick's privately organised Native football team in 1888, and continued to play for both Poneke and Wellington on his return from that tour. In 1892, he started to refine and popularise the wing-forward system of play, which was a vital element of New Zealand rugby's success until 1932. At the first NZRFU annual general meeting in 1893, he proposed that the playing colours of the New Zealand side should be predominantly black with a silver fernÑa playing strip that would give the team their famous name of All Blacks. He retired from playing rugby after captaining the 1893 New Zealand side to New South Wales and Queensland, but continued in the sport as a coach and administrator. Ellison was the author of a coaching manual, The Art of Rugby Football, published in 1902. As well as being one of the first M_ori admitted to the bar, practising as a solicitor, and later as a barrister, Ellison also stood unsuccessfully for the Southern Maori parliamentary seat several times.
